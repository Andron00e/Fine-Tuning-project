# Fine-Tuning-project


  Here is my poject concerning fine-tuning of ML models. It consists of several parts mentioned below:
  * fine-tuning [openlm-research/open_llama_3b model](https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open_llama_3b) using Low-Rank Adaptation technique (LoRA) on [OpenOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) Q&A dataset
